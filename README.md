# Module 12 Note Taker Express

This project uses MySQL to create a database of employees and adds functionality to edit the database using the CLI.
## Usage/Examples

To use this app you'll need to clone the repo.  Open the files in your IDE making sure to install the dependencies.  Requires Node.

You will need to edit the access info for your own MySQL server.

Enter 'node index.js' into the terminal to launch the app.  From here you can view your database and make any changes you'd like.
## Installation

This App does not require installation.
    
## Lessons Learned

The lessons I learned from this project aren't as staggering as the last few projects have been.  It was fairly easy to implement the database and have inquirer to to the user and edit the DB.  One of the main things that I am still weak with is relational keys.  I think it may be one of those things that just takes repetition.
